# AWS Web App Lab ‚Äì EC2 + ALB + ACM

üöß **Project in progress** ‚Äì this repo documents my learning as I build and secure a web application using AWS services.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Overview

A simple cloud lab where I:
- Launch a PHP-based web app on EC2
- Secure it behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB) with HTTPS (ACM cert)
- Use IAM roles for least privilege
- Set up logging and monitoring (GuardDuty, CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs)

## Key Services Used

- EC2 (Amazon Linux 2023)
- IAM (roles, policies)
- ALB + ACM (HTTPS termination)
- S3 (hosted logs, secure buckets)
- GuardDuty (threat detection)

- Why HTTPS termination at the ALB is more secure and scalable
- How to limit EC2 Security Group exposure using ALB SGs
